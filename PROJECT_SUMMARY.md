# AI-Driven NFT-backed Micro-Lending Protocol

## Project Overview
A decentralized micro-lending platform that enables gig workers to leverage their professional credentials as collateral for loans. The system uses AI-powered reputation scoring to assess creditworthiness based on on-chain work history.

## Core Components

### 1. Professional Credential NFTs (ERC-721)
- **Purpose**: Digital certificates of completed work
- **Features**:
  - Minted by whitelisted clients for gig workers
  - Contains metadata (project details, payment, ratings)
  - Serves as verifiable work history

### 2. AI-Powered Reputation Oracle
- **Function**: Analyzes NFT credentials to generate reputation scores
- **Implementation**:
  - Off-chain AI processes NFT metadata
  - On-chain storage of reputation scores
  - Secure update mechanism via Chainlink oracles

### 3. Lending Pool
- **Purpose**: Facilitates micro-loans to gig workers
- **Features**:
  - Risk assessment using reputation scores
  - Automated loan terms based on creditworthiness
  - Collateralized by future earnings

## Technical Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Hardhat for development)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (OpenZeppelin)
- **Frontend**: Web3.js/ethers.js
- **Oracle**: Chainlink (simulated in prototype)
- **AI/ML**: (To be implemented) For reputation scoring

## Workflow
1. Clients mint NFTs for completed work
2. AI analyzes NFT metadata to update reputation scores
3. Gig workers request loans using reputation as collateral
4. Lending pools assess risk and offer terms
5. Repayment history feeds back into reputation system

## Key Benefits
- **For Gig Workers**:
  - Access to credit based on work history
  - Portable reputation across platforms
  - No traditional credit check required

- **For Lenders**:
  - Automated risk assessment
  - Transparent lending history
  - Collateralized by verifiable work

## Next Steps
1. Implement AI reputation scoring model
2. Integrate with Chainlink oracles
3. Develop frontend interface
4. Deploy testnet version
5. Security audits and optimizations

## Repository Structure
- `/contracts`: Smart contracts
- `/scripts`: Deployment and testing scripts
- `/test`: Test cases
- `/frontend`: Basic UI components
